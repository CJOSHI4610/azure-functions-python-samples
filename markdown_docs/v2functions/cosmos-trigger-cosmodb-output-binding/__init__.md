## FunctionDef _rot13(c)
**_rot13**: The function of _rot13 is to perform the ROT13 encryption on a single character.

**parameters**:
- c: The character to be encrypted using ROT13.

**Code Description**:
The _rot13 function takes a character as input and applies the ROT13 encryption algorithm to it. If the character is an uppercase letter, it shifts it by 13 positions cyclically within the uppercase alphabet. If the character is a lowercase letter, it does the same within the lowercase alphabet. Any other characters remain unchanged.

The function first checks if the character is an uppercase letter, then applies the ROT13 encryption formula to it. If not, it checks if the character is a lowercase letter and applies the encryption accordingly. If the character is neither an uppercase nor a lowercase letter, it returns the character unchanged.

The _rot13 function is called by the process_rot13 function in the same project. The process_rot13 function processes a string by applying the _rot13 function to each character in the string and then concatenating the results to form the final encrypted string.

**Note**:
- The _rot13 function only encrypts individual characters using the ROT13 algorithm.
- It does not handle encryption for strings, and each character must be passed individually to the function.

**Output Example**:
If _rot13('A') is called, the output will be 'N'.
If _rot13('z') is called, the output will be 'm'.
If _rot13('1') is called, the output will be '1'.
## FunctionDef process_rot13(s)
**process_rot13**: The function of process_rot13 is to apply the ROT13 encryption algorithm to each character in a given string and return the encrypted string.

**parameters**:
- s: The input string to be encrypted using ROT13.

**Code Description**:
The process_rot13 function iterates over each character in the input string 's' and applies the _rot13 function to encrypt the character. It then concatenates all the encrypted characters to form the final encrypted string. The _rot13 function handles the encryption logic for individual characters within the string.

The _rot13 function is called within the process_rot13 function to perform character-level encryption. This function is designed to work specifically with the ROT13 encryption algorithm and processes each character independently.

**Note**:
- The process_rot13 function is designed to work with strings and encrypts each character individually using the ROT13 algorithm.
- It is important to note that the function does not handle encryption for the entire string at once; each character must be passed to the function separately for encryption.

**Output Example**:
If process_rot13('Hello') is called, the output will be 'Uryyb'.
