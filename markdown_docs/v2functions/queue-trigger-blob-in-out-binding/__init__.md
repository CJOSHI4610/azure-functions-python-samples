## FunctionDef _rot13(c)
**_rot13**: The function of _rot13 is to perform the ROT13 substitution cipher on a single character.

**parameters**:
- c: A single character to be encoded using ROT13.

**Code Description**:
The _rot13 function takes a single character as input and applies the ROT13 substitution cipher to it. If the character is an uppercase letter, it shifts it by 13 positions within the range of uppercase letters. If the character is a lowercase letter, it shifts it by 13 positions within the range of lowercase letters. If the character is not a letter, it remains unchanged.

The function first checks if the character is an uppercase letter, then applies the ROT13 transformation by calculating the new character based on the position shift. It does the same for lowercase letters. If the character is not a letter, it returns the character unchanged.

This function is a simple implementation of the ROT13 cipher, which is a type of Caesar cipher used for encryption.

**Note**:
- This function only works on single characters at a time.
- The ROT13 cipher is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet.

**Output Example**:
If the input character is 'A', the output will be 'N'.
If the input character is 'm', the output will be 'z'.
## FunctionDef process_rot13(s)
**process_rot13**: The function of process_rot13 is to apply the ROT13 substitution cipher to a given string.

**parameters**:
- s: A string to be encoded using ROT13.

**Code Description**:
The process_rot13 function takes a string as input and iterates over each character in the string, applying the ROT13 substitution cipher using the _rot13 function. It generates a new string by replacing each character with its ROT13 equivalent. The function then returns the resulting encoded string.

The function utilizes a generator expression to apply the _rot13 function to each character in the input string. It then joins the transformed characters together to form the final encoded string.

**Note**:
- The ROT13 cipher is a simple letter substitution cipher that shifts letters by 13 positions in the alphabet.
- This function works on entire strings by processing each character individually.

**Output Example**:
If the input string is 'Hello', the output will be 'Uryyb'.
