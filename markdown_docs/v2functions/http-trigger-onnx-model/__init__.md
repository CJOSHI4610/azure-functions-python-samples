## FunctionDef main(req, context)
**main**: The function of main is to process an HTTP request containing an image, perform image style transfer using an ONNX model, and return the stylized image.

**parameters**:
- req: Represents the HTTP request containing the image.
- context: Contains information about the function directory.

**Code Description**:
The main function begins by logging the processing of the HTTP request. It then retrieves the body of the HTTP request, attempts to open the image from the request body, and handles any input errors by returning a specific HTTP response. If the image is successfully loaded, the function calls the run_inference function, passing the image and the function context as parameters. The stylized image returned by run_inference is then sent back as an HTTP response.

In the run_inference function, an ONNX model is loaded for image style transfer. The input image is preprocessed by resizing and converting it to the required format. Inference is run on the model to obtain the stylized image, which is then post-processed before being returned as a JPEG byte array.

**Note**: Ensure that the input image is in a compatible format for style transfer. The ONNX model "rain_princess.onnx" must be available in the function directory for successful execution.

**Output Example**:
A stylized image in the form of a JPEG byte array.
## FunctionDef run_inference(image, context)
**run_inference**: The function of run_inference is to perform image style transfer using an ONNX model and return the stylized image.

**parameters**:
- image: The input image for style transfer.
- context: The context object containing information about the function directory.

**Code Description**:
The run_inference function first loads an ONNX model for image style transfer. It preprocesses the input image by resizing and converting it to the required format. Then, it runs inference on the model to obtain the stylized image. Postprocessing involves adjusting the image size and format before returning the stylized image as a JPEG byte array.

In the calling code in the main function, an HTTP request body containing an image is processed. The image is passed to the run_inference function along with the function context. The stylized image returned by run_inference is then sent back as an HTTP response.

**Note**: Ensure the input image is in a compatible format for style transfer. The ONNX model "rain_princess.onnx" must be available in the function directory.

**Output Example**:
A stylized image in the form of a JPEG byte array.
