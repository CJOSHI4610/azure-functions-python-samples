## FunctionDef main(blobin, blobout, context)
**main**: The function of main is to process a blob trigger event, apply a watermark to an image, and save the final composite image.

**parameters**:
- blobin: Represents the input image blob.
- blobout: Represents the output blob where the watermarked image will be stored.
- context: Provides context information for the function execution.

**Code Description**:
The main function starts by logging information about the processed blob, including its name and size. It then reads the input image and watermark image, resizes the base image if necessary, sets the watermark size, and pastes the watermark onto the base image at a specified position. The function then displays the watermarked image, converts it to RGB format, and saves it as a JPEG in a memory stream. Finally, it sets the content of the output blob with the watermarked image data.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the watermark image (watermark.png) is available in the same directory as the function.
- The function uses the Pillow library for image processing, so make sure it is installed in the environment.
- Adjust the watermark position, size, and other parameters as needed for different use cases.
