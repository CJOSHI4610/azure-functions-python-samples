## FunctionDef get_feed
**get_feed**: The function of get_feed is to retrieve the latest feed entries from an RSS feed and format them into a list of dictionaries containing specific information such as ID, title, and date.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The get_feed function utilizes the feedparser library to parse the RSS feed from the specified URL. It then extracts the 5 latest feed entries, generates a unique ID for each entry based on the link, and creates a dictionary for each entry containing the ID, title, and date. These dictionaries are appended to a list and returned as the output of the function.

In the calling function main within the __init__.py file, the get_feed function is invoked to retrieve the latest feed entries. The retrieved data is stored in the 'items' key of the outdata dictionary. Subsequently, the output data is converted to JSON format and stored using the Cosmos DB output binding provided by the outdoc object.

**Note**: Ensure that the RSS_FEED_URL variable is defined and accessible within the scope of the get_feed function to successfully parse the RSS feed.

**Output Example**:
```json
[
    {
        "id": "3ca7b7b4f5c8b4e1c7b1d1f7a8e6d3a2",
        "title": "Sample Feed Title 1",
        "date": "2022-01-01"
    },
    {
        "id": "8e6d3a23ca7b7b4f5c8b4e1c7b1d1f7a",
        "title": "Sample Feed Title 2",
        "date": "2022-01-02"
    },
    ...
]
```
## FunctionDef main(mytimer, outdoc)
**main**: The function of main is to execute a timer-triggered Python function that retrieves blog feeds using the get_feed function and stores the output data in Cosmos DB using the provided outdoc object.

**parameters**:
- mytimer: Represents the timer trigger request.
- outdoc: Represents the Cosmos DB output binding.

**Code Description**: The main function first retrieves the current UTC timestamp and logs a message if the timer is past due. It then calls the get_feed function to fetch blog feeds, stores the data in the 'items' key of the outdata dictionary, converts the output to JSON format, and saves it using the Cosmos DB output binding provided by outdoc. Any exceptions encountered during this process are logged as errors.

In the get_feed function, the RSS feed is parsed from the specified URL using the feedparser library. The function extracts the 5 latest feed entries, generates a unique ID for each entry based on the link, and creates a dictionary for each entry containing the ID, title, and date. These dictionaries are appended to a list and returned as the function output.

The main function demonstrates the integration of timer triggers, external function calls, data processing, and output storage using Cosmos DB within an Azure Functions environment.

**Note**: Ensure that the RSS_FEED_URL variable is defined and accessible within the scope of the get_feed function to successfully parse the RSS feed.
