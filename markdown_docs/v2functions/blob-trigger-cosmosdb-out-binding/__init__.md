## FunctionDef main(myblob, doc)
**main**: The function of main is to process a blob trigger event, analyze the content of the blob using an external API, extract relevant information, and store the output data using Cosmos DB output binding.

**parameters**: 
- myblob: Represents the input blob trigger containing the image data.
- doc: Represents the output binding to store the analyzed data in Cosmos DB.

**Code Description**:
The main function starts by logging information about the processed blob, including its name and size. It then reads the image data from the input blob and constructs an API URL for image analysis. The function sends a POST request to the API endpoint with the image data, retrieves and parses the response JSON, and extracts relevant tags from the response to create an output data object.

Subsequently, the function logs the output data and sets it as a JSON document. Finally, it stores the output data in Cosmos DB using the provided output binding.

In case of any exceptions during the process, the function catches the exception and prints an error message.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the necessary API endpoint, headers, and parameters are correctly configured before executing the function.
- Handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the API request or data processing to maintain the function's robustness.
